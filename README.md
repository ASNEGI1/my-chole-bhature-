How to make Chole Bhature
A) soaking and pressure cooking chickpeas

1. First rinse 1 cup white chickpeas a couple of times in water. Then soak them in enough water overnight or for 7 to 8 hours.

3. Then drain the water.

4. In a 3 litre pressure cooker add the chickpeas. Also add 3 cups water and ¼ teaspoon salt. I have used a pressure cooker but you can also use a pot or pan. The chickpeas will take a lesser time to cook in the pressure cooker than cooking them in a pot. You can also add a pinch or two of baking soda while cooking them. Addition of baking soda is optional.

5. Pressure cook chickpeas for 10 to 12 whistles or for about 15 to 20 minutes or till they are tender and cooked well. Once the pressure settles down on its own then open the lid of pressure cooker and check if the chickpeas are cooked well or not. It is important to cook them till they are soft and have a melt in the mouth texture.

If cooking them in a pan then it can take about an hour or more. Just ensure they are well cooked. Timing to cook chickpeas will depend upon their quality and age.

6. Once done then drain all the water and keep the cooked chickpeas aside.

Instructions
Pressure Cooking Chickpeas

Rinse the white chickpeas for a couple of times in water. Then soak the chickpeas in enough water overnight or for 7 to 8 hours.
Next day drain all the water and cook the chickpeas with water+salt in a pressure cooker or a pot.
You can also add a pinch or two of baking soda while cooking the chickpeas.
Drain the water and keep the chickpeas aside.
Making The Curry
In a grinder or blender take 1 medium sized chopped onion, 2 medium sized chopped tomatoes, 1 inch chopped ginger, 4 to 5 garlic cloves and 1 chopped green chili. 
Grind or blend to a fine paste.
No need to add water while making the paste as the juice of the tomatoes will help in making the paste.
Keep the paste aside.
Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil in a pan or kadai/wok.
Add the whole garam masala (spices) - 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, 1 large tej patta, 2 inch cinnamon, 2 to 3 cloves, 2 green cardamom and 2 to 3 black peppercorns.
Fry the whole garam masala mentioned above till the oil become fragrant. But don't burn them.
Add the ground paste and saute till the oil starts to leave the sides of the masala paste.
Keep stirring often. Sauté for 8 to 10 minutes or more till the oil starts to leave the sides of the masala paste and the paste thickens and becomes glossy. Stir while sautéing so that the paste does not stick to the pan.
Next add all the dry spice powders - ½ teaspoon turmeric powder (haldi), ¼ teaspoon red chili powder, 1 teaspoon coriander powder (dhania powder), 1 pinch asafoetida (optional) and ½ or 1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur).
Mix very well and saute for a minute or two. Now add the cooked chickpeas and stir.
Add 1 to 1.5 cups water or add as required. Also add salt as per taste and mix well.
Simmer the gravy on a low or medium flame for 12 to 15 minutes or till the curry thickens. Don't cover the pan. Stir occasionally.
Mash a few chickpeas with the back of spoon. This helps in thickening the gravy.
Lastly add 1 slit green chili and 1 teaspoon garam masala powder or chole masala powder. Mix well and simmer for a minute or two.
Check the seasoning and add more salt or spice powders if required. Garnish the curry with coriander leaves.
You can also garnish with some slit green chilies and ginger julienne.
Serve chickpea curry with onion slices, lemon wedges along with bhatura. Enjoy the chickpea curry with bhature.
Making Bhatura
Using a sieve, sift the maida (all-purpose flour), salt and baking soda in a mixing bowl. Then add the semolina and sugar to the sifted ingredients.
Now to the sifted ingredients, add the curd (yogurt). Mix very well with a spoon.
Adding water in parts first mix and then knead to a smooth and soft dough.
Cover the dough with a wet cotton napkin and let it rest for 2 hours.
After 2 hours, pinch medium-sized balls from the dough.
Roll the dough piece to a neat ball between your palms. Place the dough ball on your work surface and press it lightly with your fingers. Spread a bit of oil on both sides of the dough. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough ball into an oval or elongated shape. You can also make a round circle.
In a pan or kadai heat oil on medium-high heat for deep frying. Drop the rolled dough in hot oil and it will quickly start puffing in the oil.
When the sizzling of the oil stops, turn over the bhatura and fry the other side. You can flip once or twice for even cooking.
When light golden or golden, remove the bhatura and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil. Roll and fry all bhaturas this way.

you can, but cover them with a moist cotton napkin or kitchen towel, so that the rolled dough do not dry out.

Hi Dassana! Your recipes have transformed my cooking and my whole family is grateful! Question: when making masalas from whole spices (as above or garam masala recipe), do I also grind the tejpatta? or do I leave it whole? Thank you!5 stars

thanks cynthia. nice to know. in this recipe tej patta is not ground but fried in oil. in some recipes when the garam masala powder is made, there tej patta is ground with the other spices. i have a chickpea curry recipe where the tejpatta is ground. basically depends on the recipe.
